    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they
      will only know once <br />
      they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of
      petals and the other <br />
      has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.<br />
      <br />
      Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and
      return true if they <br />
      are in love and false if they aren't. <br />
